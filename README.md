# proxy_logger
<p>The project consists of two docker containers: nginx that logs requests and responses and my-http-server that processes requests and sends responses. 
To start using the project you need to set up a netcat listener. Before that download the repo, navigate to the root folder of the project, and run "docker-compose up --build" to build the docker-compose. After that start a netcat listener that mirrors the traffic "nc -l 8003 | tee >(nc 0.0.0.0 9000) >(nc wiki.cs.hse.ru 80)". After this, assign http_proxy environmental variable to localhost:8003 (export http_proxy="localhost:8003"). And now you can send requests to wiki.cs.hse.ru (curl http://wiki.cs.hse.ru) and receive responses from both servers. You can also find the server.log file in the running nginx docker container directory. For this, run "docker exec -it <container_ID> /bin/sh", navigate to /var/log/nginx and open server.log file.</p>
